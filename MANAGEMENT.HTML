<H2>RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION</H2>
<BODY BGCOLOR="RED"> <BODY BGCOLOR="GREEN">Now that you have wrapped up the application phase of the employee selection process, you have a collection of resumes or CVs to sift through and filter those deemed suitable for a screening call.<BR> What you’ll need to do now is go through resumes one by one, whether manually or software-assisted, and identify prime candidates.<BR>
This is one of the most traditional employee selection methods to move candidates to the next step by identifying and disqualifying those who don’t quite fit what you’re looking for.<BR>
There may be hundreds – in some cases, thousands – of applicants for a single job. There are numerous ways to filter resumes:<BODY BGCOLOR="GREEN">
<H2>SCREENING AND SHORT LISTING.</H2>In the recruitment process, shortlisting comes after sourcing (finding and attracting) and before interviewing and further assessing.<BR> Screening and shortlisting often happens simultaneously:<BR> as you screen resumes from candidates, you shortlist the best ones to move forward.
<H3>INVITING FOR INTERVIEW</H3>Formal Follow a set formula:

    formal words: 'kind invitation', 'great pleasure', 'regret', etc.<BR>
    Use third person ('they') instead of first person (T, 'We')
    Address of the writer and the date to be written.


<H4>IQ TEST</H4>
To sum up, common IQ questions are asked to test the quickness, intelligence, activeness, and presence of mind of a candidate.<BR> The focus is to select the right candidate for a particular role. All these questions are set from real-life situations to identify your unique traits.
<H4>WORK SAMPLE TEST</H4><BR>Work Sample tests are based on the premise that the best predictor of future behavior is observed behavior under similar situations.</BR> These tests require the examinee to perform tasks that are similar to those that are performed on the job.


<H4>JOB KNOWLEDGE TEST</H4>

<P>A job knowledge test is an assessment used to judge an individual's knowledge about the various aspects of a specific job.</p> A job knowledge test will assess the person's factual knowledge about the role as well as his or her procedural knowledge.

In contrast to an aptitude test that assesses an individual's natural skills and abilities, job knowledge tests are designed to confirm the individual's technical knowledge or professional expertise. The test assesses the individual's current state of knowledge about the subject matter of the test. However, the test is not designed to predict the individual's aptitude in applying that knowledge or his or her personality traits.

Job knowledge tests may also be called achievement or mastery tests.

<H4>INTEGRITY TEST</H4><p>The most widely used non-destructive integrity test is the bubble point test. Bubble point is based on the fact that liquid is held in the pores of the filter by surface tension and capillary forces.</P> The minimum pressure required to force liquid out of the pores is a measure of the pore diameter (see formula).


<H4>PEER RATING</H4><BR>Although peer ratings are somewhat cumbersome when completed on paper because multiple ratings are required to achieve reliability, they remain one of the easiest and most comprehensive methods available to assess the skills of an individual physician.
